# Hi, I'm Diogo Caixeta 👋

### Technical Founder & Growth Architect

I'm a builder at the intersection of technology, marketing, and operations. I specialize in architecting and engineering scalable GTM and operational systems from scratch, always with a relentless focus on solving critical business challenges and driving measurable growth.

### 🚀 About My Work & Contributions

My GitHub activity graph reflects my daily work, but the vast majority of my code and contributions are in **private repositories** due to client confidentiality and NDAs. 

To provide a transparent look into my projects—including architecture, technologies, and business results—I've created a curated portfolio.
